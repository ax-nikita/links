        <h2>Rules for Accepting Deposits and Sales at the Bank</h2>
        <p><strong>RG</strong> - Rusty Gears</p>
        <h3>1. Buy/Sale</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1.1. Bank employees may refuse a transaction without providing reasons.</li>
            <li>1.2. Purchases/sales are conducted without negotiation; all calculations are made using the calculator
                provided on the bank's website.
            </li>
            <li>1.3. The commission for purchase/sale is 5 RG.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2. Investment</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2.1. <strong>Request for Withdrawal:</strong> After the contract term expires, the client must request
                bank employees to prepare a safe deposit box for fund withdrawal. If no withdrawal request is made
                within 1 month after the deposit term expires, half of the RG amount will be deducted for each month of
                inactivity.
            </li>

            <li>2.2. <strong>Deposit Terms:</strong> Deposits are accepted for a specified term with fixed withdrawal
                conditions. The interest rate and deposit term must be clearly stated and calculated using the
                calculator on the website.
            </li>

            <li>2.3. <strong>Withdrawal Amount:</strong> The amount eligible for withdrawal will be specified upon
                acceptance of the deposit. The client may receive part of the amount in RG in the form of other ingots,
                at the bank's discretion. In this case, the number of ingots is calculated as if the client is
                purchasing ingots worth RG from the bank.
            </li>

            <li>2.4. <strong>Withdrawal Commission:</strong> If the client receives ingots instead of RG, the deposit
                commission will be refunded.
            </li>

            <li>2.5. <strong>Change of Terms:</strong> The bank reserves the right to change deposit and sales terms
                with prior notice to clients.
            </li>

            <li>2.6. <strong>Bank Liability:</strong> The bank is not responsible for any potential losses incurred by
                clients due to changes in market value of ingots or other assets.
            </li>

            <li>2.7. <strong>Deposit Commission:</strong> The commission consists of 5 RG + 5 RG for each month of
                deposit.
            </li>

            <li>2.8. Bank employees may refuse a withdrawal without providing reasons.</li>
